## Project Description
The Productivity Tracker Chrome Extension is a simple and effective browser-based application developed to help users monitor and manage their daily internet usage. The main purpose of this project is to improve personal productivity by tracking the time spent on different websites and providing useful insights into browsing behavior.

This extension runs in the background of the Chrome browser and continuously monitors the active tab to calculate the time spent on each website. It automatically records the browsing duration and stores the collected data using Chrome’s local storage. The stored information is then displayed through a user-friendly popup interface, allowing users to easily view their activity and understand how their time is distributed across different websites.

One of the important features of this extension is website-wise time tracking, which helps users identify how much time they spend on specific websites such as educational platforms, social media, or entertainment sites. This helps users recognize distractions and manage their time more effectively. In addition, the extension also calculates the total browsing time, giving users a complete overview of their daily internet usage.

The system also provides a daily goal-setting feature, where users can set their personal productivity goals based on time limits. This encourages users to control excessive browsing and maintain a balanced use of online resources. The goal and tracking information are clearly displayed in the extension popup for easy access.

The user interface of the extension is designed to be simple, interactive, and visually appealing. It uses a clean layout with a colorful design to improve user experience and make the information easy to understand. The interface displays the daily goal, total time spent, and website usage statistics in an organized manner.

The project is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with the Chrome Extension API for handling background operations, tab monitoring, and data storage. The extension demonstrates practical implementation of browser extension development concepts, including background processing and client-side storage management.

Overall, the Productivity Tracker Chrome Extension helps users become more aware of their browsing habits and supports better time management. It provides a practical solution for improving productivity by monitoring online activities and encouraging responsible internet usage. This project highlights the effective use of web technologies to build a real-world application that enhances user productivity and digital discipline.
